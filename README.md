Svelte JSON Schema Form

Inspired by [React JSON Schema Form](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form).

But there will be a few differences in approach.

1. Will be style agnostic using headless components and providing a way to override the styles
2. Will allow schema extension and probably a different way of stating UI configuration
3. Uses Vite ecosystem

**WIP** Expect ðŸ’¥ bugs ðŸ’¥
